# Yet Another Python IRC Bot
## Hello there, fellow IRC addicts
This is a pretty useless bot, mostly used for implementing wierd stuff, and better learning python for my own sake.

## Usage
* Ensure that python3, requests and lxml packages are installed (on debian: apt-get install python3 python3-lxml python3-requests)
* Download this piece of software
* Copy config.json.sample to config.json and edit config.json
* Play ball (e.g. "python3 bot.py")

## Plans
... not so much. OOP stuff, support for adding stuff to the bot while it's running. Perhaps even send raw command to it from the shell somehow. CTCP stuff?

## License
Do whatever you want with this bot.
